Syntax Validation: Ensuring the parser correctly identifies valid and invalid assembly syntax.
Instruction Parsing: Verification of correct parsing of various assembly instructions.
Directive Handling: Testing how assembler directives are parsed and handled.
Label Resolution: Ensuring labels within the assembly code are correctly resolved to addresses or offsets.
Symbol Table Management: Testing the management and resolution of symbols defined or used in the assembly code.
Immediate Values: Parsing and handling of immediate values within instructions.
Register Operand Parsing: Correct parsing of register operands in instructions.
Memory Operand Parsing: Testing parsing of memory operands, including addressing modes.
Data Definitions: Handling of data definition directives for reserving and initializing memory.
Macro Expansion: If applicable, testing how macros are expanded within the assembly code.
Section and Segment Handling: Parsing and management of assembly code sections or segments.
Error Reporting: Verifying that meaningful error messages are generated for syntax and semantic errors.
Comment Handling: Ensuring comments are correctly ignored and don't affect parsing.
Line and File Directives: Handling of line and file directives for debugging information.
Binary Encoding Verification: After parsing, ensuring that the binary encoding of instructions matches specifications.
Compatibility: Testing compatibility with various assembly language standards and extensions.
Performance: Assessing the performance of the parser with large or complex assembly files.
Robustness: Testing parser behavior with edge cases and malformed input.
