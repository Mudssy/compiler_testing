I want to test different sections of compilers for the C programming language.
I want to test the {feature} feature for the C programming language for the {section} section of the compiler.
Here is my test case: {test}
When the test case is run, it returns an error or does not return the expected output.
Fix this test case in order to fix any syntax,logical and run-time issues.
Do not include any explanation or and writing, just the program to be run. Also do not include any non standard libraries that will need to be added. 
Finally, make sure the code generated is compatible with the C programming language and not C++ and do not make the test cases compiler specific.
